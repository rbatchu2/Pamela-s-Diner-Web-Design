            <h4>Best way to end our weekend in Pittsburgh</h4>
            <div><p>
              We stopped at Pamela's in the Strip District for brunch before heading home after a weekend. I had the French Toast (very good), and a side of the Pittsburgh Hash (delicious). My family had pancakes, chorizo hash, and eggs. All of it was wonderful and filling. The servers were very bubbly and super friendly
